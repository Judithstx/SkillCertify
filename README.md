(contract-call? .skillcertify add-authorized-signer 'SP1234...SIGNER)
```

#### 3. Issue Certification
```clarity
(contract-call? .skillcertify issue-certification
  'SP1234...HOLDER
  "Software Development"
  "Full Stack Developer Certification"
  u2  ;; Intermediate level
  u52560  ;; Valid for ~1 year
  "https://metadata.example.com/cert123"
)
```

### For Certificate Holders

## üîÑ Renewal Process Flow

### 1. Pre-Renewal Phase
- Certificate holders accumulate CE credits through professional development activities
- System tracks CE credits per certification
- Renewal window opens 30 days before expiry

### 2. Renewal Eligibility Check
- Verify certificate is within renewal window
- Confirm sufficient CE credits accumulated
- Calculate required renewal fee

### 3. Renewal Execution
- Submit renewal request with metadata
- Pay renewal fee in STX tokens
- System validates CE requirements
- Automatic approval and certificate extension

### 4. Post-Renewal
- Certificate expiry date extended
- Renewal count incremented
- CE credits counter reset for next renewal cycle

## üîê Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only registered issuers can create certifications
- Multi-signature requirements enforced by certification level
- Authorized signers must be explicitly added by issuer
- Proposals expire after ~1 week to prevent stale requests
- Only certificate holders can renew their own certificates

### Input Validation
- All string inputs validated for minimum length
- Certification levels restricted to valid range (1-4)
- Validity periods must be positive
- Duplicate signatures prevented
- CE credits capped per activity and update
- Renewal fees validated against certification levels

### Financial Security
- STX payments securely transferred to contract treasury
- Renewal fees stored and tracked in contract
- Payment validation before renewal processing

### Error Handling
| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| u401 | Unauthorized access |
| u404 | Resource not found |
| u409 | Resource already exists |
| u400 | Invalid input parameters |
| u410 | Certificate expired |
| u411 | Insufficient signatures |
| u412 | Already signed |
| u413 | Proposal expired |
| u414 | Insufficient payment |
| u415 | Renewal not eligible |
| u416 | Insufficient CE credits |
| u417 | Renewal too early |
